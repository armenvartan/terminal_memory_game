terminal_memory_game
====================

A game where you try to remember strings of letters.  

My goals with this game were:  

1. Create a project without being given parameters or initial test code (At this writing, I'm a week 2 student at DBC)
2. Improve my Object Oriented design
3. Make a Ruby program that uses a SQL database.  

If you want or need to reset the database, type  
    $cat schema.sql | sqlite3 scores.db  
if the db gets corrupted, remove the db file before doing that.
